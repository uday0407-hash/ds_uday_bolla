# **Data Science Assignment - WEB3 Trading Team**

##### ***Project Overview***



This project analyzes the relationship between crypto trader behavior (from `historical\_data.csv`) and the overall market sentiment (from the Fear \& Greed Index).



The primary goal was to move beyond surface-level averages and find actionable patterns. I focused on segmenting traders by performance (Top 10% vs. Bottom 10%) to see how their strategies, risk-taking, and asset choices differ during "Fear" and "Greed" market phases.



##### **File Structure**



\* `/notebook\_1.ipynb`: The main Google Colab notebook containing all Python code, analysis, and visualization.

\* `/csv\_files/`: Contains the two raw datasets provided (`historical\_data.csv`, `fear\_greed\_index.csv`).

\* `/outputs/`: All 7 plots and charts generated by the notebook are saved here.

\* `/ds\_report.pdf`: A 1-2 page summary of the key findings and actionable strategies

\* `/README.md`: This file.



##### **How to Run**



1\.  Open `notebook\_1.ipynb` in Google Colab.

2\.  The first code cell creates the `csv\_files/` and `outputs/` directories.

3\.  Upload `historical\_data.csv` and `fear\_greed\_index.csv` into the `csv\_files/` folder in the Colab environment.

4\.  Run all cells sequentially from top to bottom.

5\.  The notebook will run the full analysis and save all 7 plots to the `outputs/` folder, which you can then view in the report.



##### **Key Dependencies**



The analysis was performed using standard Python data science libraries:

\* `pandas`

\* `numpy`

\* `matplotlib`

\* `seaborn`
